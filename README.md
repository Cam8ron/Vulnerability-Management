<B> This repository contains a Home Lab that demonstrates the use of Nessus for Vulnerability Management. 

Nessus was utilized to scan a Windows 10 virtual machine with an depreciated Firefox version in a non-credentialed and  credentialed scan. 

<h2>Non-credentialed scan of local machine before installing depreciated Firefox version</h2>

<h2>Credentialed scan of local machine after installing depreciated Firefox version</h2>
 
<B> Notice how the credentialed scan after installing Firefox brings to the table many more critical vulnerabilities. This is because the version of Firefox is from 2016 and as time goes by and new vulnerabilities come into play this version becomes more and more vulnerable.

<h2>Remediation of Vulnerabilities</h2>

 To remediate some of the critical vulnerabilities and many others I decided to uninstall Firefox as a whole from the system. I also decided to update Windows to the most recent version available. Patch management is very important when it comes to keeping a system as secure as it can be.

<h2>Credentialed scan after remediation efforts</h2>

Notice how after uninstalling Firefox from the system and updating Windows to the most recent version available it remediated majority of the critical vulnerabilities and many others.
