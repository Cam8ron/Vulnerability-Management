<B> This repository contains a Home Lab that demonstrates the use of Nessus for Vulnerability Management. 

Nessus was utilized to scan a Windows 10 virtual machine with an depreciated Firefox version in a non-credentialed and credentialed scan. 

<h2>Non-credentialed scan of local machine before installing depreciated Firefox version</h2>

<h2>Credentialed scan of local machine after installing depreciated Firefox version</h2>
 
<B> Notice how the credentialed scan after installing Firefox introduces critical vulnerabilities. This is because this version of Firefox is from 2016 and new vulnerablities have been discovered since then.

<h2>Remediation of Vulnerabilities</h2>

 To remediate the critical vulnerabilities and others I decided to uninstall Firefox as a whole from the system. I also decided to update Windows to the most recent version available. Patch management is very important when it comes to keeping a system as secure.

<h2>Credentialed scan after remediation efforts</h2>

Notice how after uninstalling Firefox from the system and updating Windows to the most recent version available it remediated the critical vulnerabilities and many others.
