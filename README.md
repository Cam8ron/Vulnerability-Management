<h1>Vulnerability Management</h1>

<B> This repository contains a PowerShell script that parses Windows Event Log data to identify unsuccessful RDP attacks. The script also leverages a third-party API to obtain geographic information about the attacker's location. 

The script is utilized by showcasing the setup of Azure Sentinel, a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution, to monitor a live virtual machine that acts as a honeypot. During the demonstration, we can observe live RDP brute force attacks originating from various locations worldwide. To plot the geolocation information of the attackers on an Azure Sentinel Map, I will utilize a custom PowerShell script.

<h2>Description</h2>
<b>This repository hosts a PowerShell script that extracts data from the Windows Event Log to identify unsuccessful Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) attacks. Additionally, the script integrates with a third-party API to gather geolocation details about the attackers.

<br />
<br />
The script is featured in a demo where I establish an Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and establish a live virtual machine acting as a honeypot. In this demo, we can observe active RDP brute force attacks coming from different regions worldwide. To chart the geolocation data of the attackers on an Azure Sentinel Map, I will use a tailored PowerShell script.
